abstract: Anticounterfeiting technology has received tremendous interest for its significance in daily necessities, medical industry, and high-end products. Confidential tags based on photoluminescence are one of the most widely used approaches for their vivid visualization and high throughput. However, the complexity of confidential tags is generally limited to the accessibility of inks and their spatial location; generating an infinite combination of emission colors is therefore a challenging task. Here, we demonstrate a concept to create complex color light mixing in a confined space formed by microscale optofluidic concave interfaces. Infinite color combination and capacity were generated through chaotic behavior of light mixing and interaction in an ininkjet-printed skydome structure. Through the chaotic mixing of emission intensity, wavelength, and light propagation trajectories, the visionary patterns serve as a highly unclonable label. Finally, a deep learning-based machine vision system was built for the authentication process. The developed anticounterfeiting system may provide inspiration for utilizing space color mixing in optical security and communication applications.

abstract: Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is fundamental to many applications. Existing works have used graph neural networks (GNNs) for (approximate) SAT solving. Typical GNN-based end-to-end SAT solvers predict SAT solutions concurrently. We show that for a group of symmetric SAT problems, the concurrent prediction is guaranteed to produce a wrong answer because it neglects the dependency among Boolean variables in SAT problems. We propose AsymSAT, a GNN-based architecture which integrates recurrent neural networks to generate dependent predictions for variable assignments. The experiment results show that dependent variable prediction extends the solving capability of the GNN-based method as it improves the number of solved SAT instances on large test sets.
